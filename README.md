# New York Taxi Trip Analysis

## Introduction

The New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC), created in 1971, is the agency responsible for licensing and 
regulating New York City's Medallion (Yellow) taxi cabs, for-hire vehicles (community-based liveries, black cars and 
luxury limousines), commuter vans, and paratransit vehicles. In partnership with the New York City Department of 
Information Technology and Telecommunications (DOITT), TLC has published millions of trip records from both yellow 
medallion taxis and green SHLs. Publicizing trip record data through an open platform permits instant access to records 
which previously were available only through a formal process (FOIL request.) The TLC does not collect any information 
regarding its passengers.

The yellow and green taxi trip records include fields capturing pick-up and drop-off dates/times, pick-up and drop-off 
locations, trip distances, itemized fares, rate types, payment types, and driver-reported passenger counts. The data 
used in the attached datasets were collected and provided to the NYC Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC) by technology 
providers authorized under the Taxicab & Livery Passenger Enhancement Programs (TPEP/LPEP).Â The trip data was not 
created by the TLC, and TLC makes no representations as to the accuracy of these data.

For our project we will be working with data from the year 2017 and 2018 for Yellow and Green Taxies. 
**Total volume of raw data is ~21 GB.**

### New York City's Medallion (Yellow) taxi cabs
Yellow taxicabs are the iconic, yellow vehicles that have the right to pick up street-hailing passengers anywhere in New
 York City. Taxis can also be dispatched by TLC-licensed E-Hail companies. By law, there are 13,587 taxis in New York 
 City and each taxi must have a medallion affixed to it. Vehicles can be owned by drivers or leased to them by licensed 
 garages. Grant funding is available for wheelchair accessible taxis.

### New York City's Green taxi cabs
Green taxis, also known as boro taxis and street-hail liveries, were introduced in August of 2013 to improve taxi 
service and availability in the boroughs. Green taxis may respond to street hails, but only in certain designated areas.
